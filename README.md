# 📱 Openin Clone

## Description

Welcome to the Openin Clone project repository! This repository contains a clone of the Openin app, which addresses the issue of social media links redirecting to web browsers instead of their respective apps.

## What's Broken? 🚫

On platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, Telegram, and Quora, tapping on links shared by creators to YouTube videos opens the YouTube website instead of the YouTube app. This prevents users from enjoying videos in full screen and engaging with them through likes, comments, and subscriptions.

## We Have a Fix! 🛠️

To enhance user experience, we have developed OpeninApp, a tool that ensures social media links open directly in their respective apps. With OpeninApp, you can seamlessly enjoy videos in full screen, interact with content through likes, comments, and subscriptions, and avoid the inconvenience of web browsers.
